# Quiz-React-Task

usage: 

```sh

cd Quiz-FE-Task

npm install 

npm start

```


Libraries used: material ui , react quizzes , auth0 for handling authentication 

Logic: 

- React quizzes for building the quiz questions and answers 

- Adding some custom input fields such as : URL, Title, Description 

- Answer quiz view functionality as required 



Done : 

- created quiz questions 
- quizzes list view 

### N.B: 
- in create quiz view: make sure you clicked on any of UI components such as : radio buttons, select, label, etc. 

To do: 

- edit quiz view 
- then handle properly the format of data required for quiz component from react-quizzes packages; 
- quiz answer view and handling its required functionality 


I used the local storage to store the quizzes array data
